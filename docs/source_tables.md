# Source Tables: MPC/SBN Database

## Overview

The SQL scripts in this project query the MPC/SBN PostgreSQL database, a
replica of the [Minor Planet Center's](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net)
observation and orbit catalogs distributed through the
[PDS Small Bodies Node](https://sbnmpc.astro.umd.edu) (SBN).

## Tables Used by This Project

### mpc_orbits

Orbital elements for minor planets. One row per object. Used to identify
NEOs by orbital criteria rather than requiring an external NEA list download.

**Columns used:**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `packed_primary_provisional_designation` | text | Primary designation (packed, unique key) |
| `unpacked_primary_provisional_designation` | text | Primary designation (human-readable) |
| `q` | double precision | Perihelion distance (au) |
| `orbit_type_int` | integer | MPC orbital classification (nullable; NULL for 35%) |

**NEO selection criteria:** `q < 1.32 OR orbit_type_int IN (0, 1, 2, 3, 20)`

**Caveats:** `orbit_type_int` is NULL for ~530K of 1.51M objects. These are
objects with computed orbits but no MPC classification. The perihelion
criterion (`q < 1.32`) catches NEOs regardless of classification status.

### obs_sbn

The primary observation table. Each row is a single astrometric observation
of a solar system object. This is the largest table in the database.

**Columns used:**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `permid` | text | Permanent (numbered) designation, e.g., `"433"` |
| `provid` | text | Provisional designation, e.g., `"2024 AA1"` |
| `trksub` | text | Observer-assigned tracklet identifier (nullable; ~7% of discovery obs are NULL) |
| `stn` | text | MPC observatory code, e.g., `"703"` (Catalina) |
| `obstime` | timestamp(6) | Observation timestamp (UTC, no timezone) |
| `ra` | numeric | Right Ascension in decimal degrees (J2000) |
| `dec` | numeric | Declination in decimal degrees (J2000) |
| `mag` | numeric | Reported apparent magnitude (nullable) |
| `band` | text | Photometric band code (e.g., `'V'`, `'G'`, `'o'`) |
| `disc` | char(1) | Discovery flag: `'*'` marks the discovery observation |
| `ref`  | text    | Current MPC publication reference for this observation, e.g. `"MPS  2267054"`, `"MPEC 2024-A12"`, `"MPC 12345"` (mutable — see below) |
| `prev_ref` | text | Previous publication reference, retained when `ref` is overwritten (see below) |
| `all_pub_ref` | text[] | Array of historical publication references. Empty in our 2026-04-30 V00 NEO-discovery sample; intended use unclear. |
| `status` | char | Observation status: `'P'` / `'p'` for published, others for in-progress / rejected |
| `deprecated` | char | NULL for active observations; non-NULL marks superseded rows |

**Key behaviors:**
- An object's observations may be stored under `permid` (if numbered),
  `provid` (provisional designation), or both
- The `disc = '*'` flag marks the observation designated as the discovery
  observation by the MPC
- `trksub` groups observations into tracklets; when NULL, tracklet
  membership cannot be determined from this field alone
- **`ref` is mutable** and reflects only the *current* publication
  pointer; **`prev_ref` retains the previous one** for observations
  that have been republished — see the next subsection.
- Most analytic queries should filter `WHERE deprecated IS NULL AND
  status IN ('P','p')` — i.e., active and published.

#### `obs_sbn.ref` is not a permanent publication record

Important gotcha for any "what MPECs has site X been in?" question:
the `ref` field is **rewritten** when the observation gets republished
in a Minor Planet Supplement (MPS), which typically happens within
about a year of the original submission. So an observation that was
originally announced in `MPEC 2024-A12` (a discovery announcement)
will, after the next MPS batch, carry the MPS reference instead and
the MPEC link is lost from `obs_sbn`.

Empirical confirmation, V00 NEO discovery observations as of
2026-04-29:

| Discovery year | with MPEC ref | with MPS ref | other / none |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2019 |   0 |   5 | 0 |
| 2020 |   0 |  30 | 0 |
| 2021 |   0 | 103 | 0 |
| 2022 |   0 | 212 | 0 |
| 2023 |   0 | 195 | 0 |
| 2024 |   0 | 215 | 0 |
| 2025 |   0 | 351 | 0 |
| **2026** | **173** | 0 | 0 |

Only the current year retains the original MPEC refs. Everything
older has been demoted to MPS. By extension, queries like "all
distinct MPECs that reference this site" return at most a rolling
~one-year snapshot, not a historical total.

Implications:

- **You can answer current-snapshot questions directly from
  `obs_sbn.ref`** — what MPECs is this site tagged in *right now*,
  what's the MPS publication backlog (rows with NULL or empty ref).
- **`prev_ref` recovers the original publication ref** for one
  cycle of republication. Empirical (V00 NEO discovery obs,
  2026-04-30):

  | Disc year | rows | with prev_ref | prev_ref class |
  |---:|---:|---:|---|
  | 2019 |   5 | 0   | — |
  | 2020 |  30 | 2   | MPS |
  | 2021 | 103 | 1   | MPS |
  | 2022 | 212 | 68  | **MPEC** |
  | 2023 | 195 | 194 | **MPEC** |
  | 2024 | 215 | 211 | MPEC (161) + MPS (50) |
  | 2025 | 351 | 351 | MPEC (296) + MPS (55) |
  | 2026 | 175 | 0   | (current `ref` already MPEC) |

  So **for 2022-onwards V00 NEO discoveries the original announcement
  MPEC is recoverable from `prev_ref`**, with ≥99 % coverage from 2023.
  Older years are blank — the column wasn't populated before some
  upstream MPC schema change. The handful of MPS-in-prev_ref rows
  are observations that went through ≥2 publication cycles, where
  prev_ref itself got overwritten.

- **You cannot answer historical-MPEC questions for pre-2022 data
  from `obs_sbn` alone.** For that era, MPC's MPEC archive
  (https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/MPECs.html and the
  per-year listings) is the immutable source of truth; cross-
  reference by designation + observation date.
- **MPS refs *are* persistent** once written — supplements don't get
  re-published — so the routine-astrometric-publication count
  (distinct MPS refs per site) is a reliable historical figure.
- The discovery count itself (`disc = '*'`) is also persistent,
  even though its associated `ref` rotates. So "number of
  discovery MPECs" can be approximated as "number of distinct
  discovery tracklets", under the assumption that nearly every NEO
  discovery from a major survey generates exactly one announcement
  MPEC at submission time. For 2022+ the actual MPEC ID is also
  recoverable via `prev_ref`.

### numbered_identifications

Cross-reference between permanent numbers and provisional designations.
One row per numbered object. This is the authoritative source for mapping
a numbered asteroid to its principal provisional designation.

**Columns used:**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `permid` | text | The permanent number as a string, e.g., `"433"` |
| `packed_primary_provisional_designation` | text | Packed form, e.g., `"A898P00A"` |
| `unpacked_primary_provisional_designation` | text | Unpacked form, e.g., `"1898 PA"` |

**Key behaviors:**
- Continuously updated as new objects receive numbered designations
- Links to `current_identifications` via the provisional designation fields
- Used in preference to `mpc_orbits` for designation lookup because
  `numbered_identifications` is fully populated while `mpc_orbits` is
  partially populated and undergoing consistency work

### obscodes

Observatory metadata. One row per MPC observatory code. Used to enrich
discovery tracklet output with human-readable observatory names.

**Columns used:**

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `obscode` | varchar(4) | MPC station code, e.g., `"703"` (unique) |
| `name` | varchar | Observatory name |

full schema details, join paths, and latency analysis.

## Tables Available for Future Use

### current_identifications

Links primary provisional designations to all secondary (linked) designations.
Each object may appear multiple times — once per secondary designation.

| `packed_primary_provisional_designation` | text | Primary designation (packed) |
| `unpacked_primary_provisional_designation` | text | Primary designation (unpacked) |
| `packed_secondary_provisional_designation` | text | Secondary designation (packed) |
| `unpacked_secondary_provisional_designation` | text | Secondary designation (unpacked) |
| `numbered` | boolean | Whether the primary designation is also numbered |
| `object_type` | integer | Object classification |

**Potential use:** Fallback matching for observations stored under a secondary
designation that doesn't match the primary designation in NEA.txt.

**Potential use:** Earth MOID-based risk ranking, Tisserand parameter
computation, covariance extraction from JSONB. See `sandbox/schema_review.md`
for JSONB structure analysis.

## Recommended Indexes

See [`sql/common/indexes.sql`](../sql/common/indexes.sql) for index
definitions that improve query performance. These are safe to create on a
read-only replica. Note the MPC's warning: excessive indexing can cause
replication lag.
